# django1
my first django(a python framework for web development) project for the laboratory course in university.  

you should first initialize a django project so first execute the following command to install django framework on your computer : "pip install django"  
to initialize django project use this command : "django-admin startproject YUOR_PROJECT_NAME"  
in the next step copy the files from django1/Proj in this repository and paste them into your project folder(point: replace the duplicate files)  
now you should install all of the packages mentioned in requirements.txt file by this command : "pip install -r requirements.txt"  
now for ensuring that the database files have been initialized , use this commands : "python manage.py makemigrations" , "python manage.py migrate"  
now you can run the project by "python manage.py runserver"  
if there is a problem , just let me know  
link to my project : "http://a99521469.pythonanywhere.com/blog/home/" but I don't know how long the python anywhere servers are going to serve me :)  
Thanks
